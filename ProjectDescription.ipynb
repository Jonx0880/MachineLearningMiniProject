    "Mini Project: Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning\n",
    "- Project Description\n",
    "In this mini project, you will develop a predictive maintenance system using machine\n",
    "learning techniques. The goal is to predict machine failures based on sensor data from\n",
    "industrial equipment. You will work with a dataset containing various sensor measurements\n",
    "and use two different machine learning models of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset\n",
    "You will use the \"AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset\" from the UCI Machine Learning\n",
    "Repository.\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Air temperature [K]\n",
    "\n",
    "• Process temperature [K]\n",
    "\n",
    "• Rotational speed [rpm]\n",
    "\n",
    "• Torque [Nm]\n",
    "\n",
    "• Tool wear [min]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is 'Machine failure' (0 for no failure, 1 for failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Jupyter notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations for each\n",
    "task (each group submits one)\n",
    "\n",
    "• A brief summarization your approach, key findings, and recommendations in final\n",
    "report as part two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "• Correctness and completeness of the implemented tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "• Quality of code and adherence to best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "• Depth of analysis and insights derived from the data and models\n",
    "\n",
    "• Clarity of explanations and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "• Criteria of model selection, model improvement strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "• Justification for choices made throughout the project\n"
